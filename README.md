The Grateful Dead was an American jam band established in 1965 that fused many genres of music such as folk, jazz, blues, psychedelic rock, and gospel. They were especially known for their live performances with lengthy instrumental jams, which would usually be elaborations on some basis tunes - for example, there exist 80 versions alone of Dark Star on Spotify. Have these basis tunes varied in style throughout their 30-year stint - could they be split into specific "eras"?

To support my corpus, I will look at several songs that have been heavily played by the Grateful Dead throughout their career, in this way comparing and contrasting my findings. Another reason for picking various songs is also simply because they would not use some tracks at all in some periods - Dark Star was never played at all between 1974 and 1978. The basis tunes I will use will be Dark Star, Not Fade Away, China Cat Sunflower, and Me And My Uncle, all songs the Grateful Dead have played around 400-600 times each in their career.

I began my preliminary investigation through China Cat Sunflower, by compiling the tracks available on spotify into seven playlists, depending on when the renditions were recorded. These periods are unevenly distributed, as most of the live recordings of the performances are found in the early seventies. The periods I have chosen are:

1967-1968: early years before the studio recording

1969-1970: performances during/after the studio recording

1971-1972: period with most performance activity

1973-1976: most commercially successful period

1977-1981: "golden" period

1982-1988: health decline of Jerry Garcia

1989-1995: final years of the group

One interesting observation I have found that so-called "golden" period, regarded by plenty of Dead fans as being their greatest live period, has the closest features to the original studio recording in 1969, with a measured mean energy (M = 0.580) being closest to the energy of the studio recording (0.581), with the second-closest being the second and third period with 0.563-0.565 energy. The golden period also has a very comparable tempo (M = 95.5, compared to the original 96.9 tempo, with the closest being the second period at the slightly closer 98.2).

I have found the most instrumental period to be the fourth period with an average speechiness of 0.0348, while the fifth and sixth period, with an average speechiness of 0.0588 and 0.0671 respectively represent a less instrumental timeframe.

The fourth period also features their lengthiest renditions of China Cat Sunflower, with an mean duration of 10.4 minutes, by far outlasting the second place, the final period at an mean of 6.5 minutes, while the tracks in the other periods last an mean of 4.5-5.5 minutes.

One setback of my comparisons is already clear in how large the standard deviations are, especially in the later periods of which there are far less renditions of China Cat Sunflower, meaning I have had to calculate the averages of only 3-5 tracks. However, I have found the highest standard deviations to occur in the fourth period, perhaps meaning that I still have yet to establish more "precise" periods for which track features are more comparable. If my findings are anything to go by, one of my most pressing tasks to come will be to explain these deviations - perhaps they are also caused by medleys, in the way the Grateful Dead fuse together multiple tunes?
